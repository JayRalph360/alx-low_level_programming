# C - Variables, if, else, while

## Keywords and identifiers
### Keywords
C keeps a small set of keywords for its own use. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers in the program — a common restriction with modern languages. Where users of Old C may be surprised is in the introduction of some new keywords; if those names were used as identifiers in previous programs, then the programs will have to be changed. It will be easy to spot, because it will provoke your compiler into telling you about invalid names for things.

### Identifiers
Identifier is the fancy term used to mean ‘name’. In C, identifiers are used to refer to a number of things: we've already seen them used to name variables and functions. They are also used to give names to some things we haven't seen yet, amongst which are labels and the ‘tags’ of structures, unions, and enums.

## If statements in C
The ability to control the flow of your program, letting it make decisions on what code to execute, is valuable to the programmer.
The if statement allows you to control if a program enters a section of code or not based on whether a given condition is true or false. One of the important functions of the if statement is that it allows the program to select an action based upon the user's input. For example, by using an if statement to check a user-entered password, your program can decide whether a user is allowed access to the program.

## C - if...else statement
If the Boolean expression evaluates to true, then the if block will be executed, otherwise, the else block will be executed.
C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as false value.

## Relational Operators in C
The following table shows all the relational operators supported by C language. Assume variable A holds 10 
and variable B holds 20 then.

## While loop in C
A while loop in C programming repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.
Here, statement(s) may be a single statement or a block of statements. The condition may be any expression, and true is any nonzero value. The loop iterates while the condition is true.
When the condition becomes false, the program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.
