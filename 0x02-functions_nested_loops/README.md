# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

## C - Functions
In c, we can divide a large program into the basic building blocks known as function. The function contains the set
of programming statements enclosed by {}. A function can be called multiple times to provide reusability and modularity
to the C program. In other words, we can say that the collection of functions creates a program. The function is also known 
as procedureor subroutinein other programming languages.

## C - Nested Loops
C supports nesting of loops in C. Nesting of loops is the feature in C that allows the looping of statements inside another loop.
Let's observe an example of nesting loops in C.

Any number of loops can be defined inside another loop, i.e., there is no restriction for defining any number of loops. 
The nesting level can be defined at n times. You can define any type of loop inside another loop; for example,
you can define 'while' loop inside a 'for' loop.
